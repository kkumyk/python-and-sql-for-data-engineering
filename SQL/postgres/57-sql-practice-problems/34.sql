/* 34. High-value customers - with discount
    - use discount when calculating high-value customers
    - the discount is applied as a percentage
    - use parenthesis around (1 - Discount) to make sure that calculation is done first
    - order by total amount, taking into consideration the discount

Expected Result:
 customerid |         companyname          | total_amount

Learnings:
The new calculation for order totals with discounts needs to be used three times in the:
    1. SELECT statement when defining the alias 
    2. HAVING clause - here we cannot use the alias and the calculation needs to be repeated
    3. ORDER BY clause - here we can reuse the alias created in the SELECT statement.

Focus: Calculating fields: when the alias for this field can be used, and when the actual calculation should be repeated in the query.

Issue Encountered:
When testing writing the query on the command line, kept getting "Column reference is ambiguous" error.
This was caused by a typo in the select statement when the two calculating columns were given the same name.
As a result, the name could not be resolved until it was corrected.
